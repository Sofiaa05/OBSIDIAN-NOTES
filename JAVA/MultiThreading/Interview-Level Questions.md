### ðŸ’¬ Q2: Why is multithreading important?

âœ… **Answer:**  
Multithreading enhances performance by allowing concurrent execution, makes programs responsive, and makes better use of CPU resources especially in multi-core systems.

### ðŸ’¬ Q3: How does thread communication happen in Java?

### ðŸ’¬ Q4: What is the difference between `Runnable` and `Thread`?

### ðŸ’¬ Q5: What happens when you call the `run()` method instead of `start()`?

âœ… **Answer:**  
It runs in the **main thread**, not as a separate thread. So no concurrency is achieved â€” the thread code runs like a normal method.

### ðŸ’¬ Q6: What is thread starvation?

âœ… **Answer:**  
When a thread waits indefinitely to gain access to resources because other threads are continuously acquiring them â€” often due to poor thread scheduling or priority management.
