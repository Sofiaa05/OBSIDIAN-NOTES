### 1. setting up backend:
- cd backend
- #### npm init -y:
  - `npm` is the Node Package Manager (comes with Node.js installation)
  - `init` tells npm to initialize a new Node.js project
  - The `-y` flag is for "yes", which automatically accepts all default options without prompting you for input
  
- This creates a **`package.json`** file in your backend directory with default values:
    
    - Sets "index.js" as the main entry point
        
    - Uses "backend" as the project name (from the directory name)
        
    - Sets version to "1.0.0"
        
    - Creates an empty description
        
    - Other default npm configuration values

The `package.json` file is important because:

- **Project Dependencies** (libraries needed to run the app).
    
-  **Project metadata** (name, version, author).
    
- Allows you to define scripts for running, testing, and building your project (`npm start`, `npm test`)
    
- Is required for installing npm packages

#### package-lock.json

This file is **auto-generated by npm** when you run `npm install`.  
It **locks the exact version** of every installed package (and sub-package), so:

- The app works **the same on every machine**
    
- It avoids unexpected bugs due to updates
    

🛑 You should **never manually edit** this file.  
✅ Always **commit it to GitHub** along with `package.json`.

### 2. install dependencies
```bash
npm install express mongoose dotenv cors nodemon
```

#### In your backend folder create these directories
### 1. `routes/` – Like a Menu in a Restaurant

**"What can people ask for in your app?"**

This folder has files that define **which URL the user can visit**, like:

- `GET /expenses` → Get all expenses
    
- `POST /expenses` → Add a new expense
    

💬 **How to say it in interview:**

> "The `routes` folder contains all the URLs or endpoints of the app. It decides what kind of requests a user can make, like getting expenses or adding a new one. It's like a menu listing all available actions."

---

### 📁 2. `controllers/` – Like the Chef in the Kitchen

**"What should happen when someone clicks a button or visits a URL?"**

This folder holds the **real action**. For example:

- When someone asks to add an expense, the controller **takes that data** and **saves it to the database**.
    
- If someone wants to delete an expense, the controller **finds it and removes it**.
    

💬 **How to say it in interview:**

> "Controllers contain the actual logic of what should happen when a route is called. For example, if the route says 'Add an expense', the controller actually adds it to the database."

---

### 📁 3. `models/` – Like a Recipe or a Blueprint

**"What does your data look like?"**

Here, you tell MongoDB **what an expense or a user should look like**.

- What fields does an expense have? `title`, `amount`, `date`, `category`, etc.
    
- What fields does a user have? `email`, `password`, etc.
    

💬 **How to say it in interview:**

> "Models define the structure of my data. For example, the Expense model tells MongoDB that every expense should have a title, amount, date, and user ID. It’s like a blueprint for what the data should look like."

---

### 📁 4. `db/` or `config/` – Like Connecting to the Fridge

**"Where is your data stored?"**

This folder helps you **connect to your MongoDB database**, whether it’s on your local machine or online.

💬 **How to say it in interview:**

> "This folder has the code to connect my app to the MongoDB database. Without this, the app can’t save or read any data."

---
### 5. `index.js` 
- `index.js` is the **main entry point** of your **backend application** — the first file that runs when you start your server.

## 🧠 Interview Tip: Speak with Examples

When asked:  
**“Explain your backend folder structure in MERN.”**

Say this:

> "Sure! In my backend, I follow an MVC-style structure:
> 
> - `routes/` define the API endpoints, like `/api/expenses`.
>     
> - `controllers/` handle what to do for each endpoint — like add, fetch, or delete expenses.
>     
> - `models/` define how my data is structured in MongoDB, for example, what fields an Expense has.
>     
> - `config/` or `db/` has my MongoDB connection logic.
>     
> 
> So, everything is organized. Routes say 'what to do', controllers say 'how to do it', models say 'what the data looks like', and the db connects it all to the database."

## 📌 Visual Map:

```bash
User clicks button in frontend
        ↓
URL hits route → routes/expenseRoutes.js
        ↓
Route calls function in controller → controllers/expenseController.js
        ↓
Controller uses model → models/Expense.js
        ↓
Model talks to MongoDB → config/db.js handles connection

```

### More Dependencies
```shell
npm i bcryptjs jsonwebtoken multer xlsx
```


## ✅ 1. `bcryptjs` — 🔐 Password Hashing

### 🔍 What it is:

A JavaScript-only version of `bcrypt` used to **securely hash passwords** before saving them to the database.

### 📌 Why use it:

- Protects passwords by storing hashed versions (not plain text)
    
- Prevents brute-force and rainbow table attacks
    
- Works well with Node.js
    

### 📘 Example:

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');

const hashed = await bcrypt.hash('password123', 10);
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare('password123', hashed);
```

---

## ✅ 2. `jsonwebtoken` — 🔐 User Authentication with Tokens (JWT)

### 🔍 What it is:

Library to create and verify **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure user login sessions.

### 📌 Why use it:

- Used in login/signup flows
    
- Allows the backend to **verify user identity** on protected routes
    
- Stores user info in a **signed token** that can’t be tampered with
    

### 📘 Example:

```js
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, 'secretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secretKey');
```

---

## ✅ 3. `multer` — 📂 File Upload Handling

### 🔍 What it is:

A middleware for handling **`multipart/form-data`**, which is used for file uploads.

### 📌 Why use it:

- Upload profile pictures, PDFs, images, videos, etc.
    
- Easily save files to disk or memory
    
- Can set size/type restrictions
    

### 📘 Example:

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  res.send('File uploaded');
});
```

---

## ✅ 4. `xlsx` — 📊 Excel File Reader/Writer

### 🔍 What it is:

Library to **read and write Excel (.xlsx or .xls) files** in Node.js.

### 📌 Why use it:

- Import data from Excel into your app
    
- Export reports/data to Excel format
    
- Useful for dashboards, finance, or admin panels
    

### 📘 Example:

```js
const XLSX = require('xlsx');

const workbook = XLSX.readFile('file.xlsx');
const sheet = workbook.Sheets[workbook.SheetNames[0]];
const data = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(sheet);
```
