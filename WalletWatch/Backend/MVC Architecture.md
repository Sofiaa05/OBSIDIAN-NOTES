### MVC stands for:

> **M** â€“ Model  
> **V** â€“ View  
> **C** â€“ Controller

Itâ€™s a **design pattern** (just a way to organize your code) used in full-stack development to **keep your project clean, understandable, and easy to manage**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Think of a Real-World Example â€“ Like a Restaurant

Letâ€™s say you're at a restaurant.

- You (the customer) **place an order** (click a button in the app)
    
- The **waiter** takes the order (controller)
    
- The **chef** looks at the **recipe** (model) and cooks the dish
    
- The dish is served on a plate (view)
    

This is exactly how MVC works in apps!

## ðŸ§© In Technical Terms (Easy Version)

|Part|Role in the App|Folder (in your app)|
|---|---|---|
|**Model**|Defines the **structure of your data** (like Expense or User)|`models/`|
|**View**|What the **user sees** on screen (buttons, charts, forms)|`frontend/src/` (React UI)|
|**Controller**|Contains the **logic** of what should happen when a user does something|`controllers/`|
## How to Explain MVC in an Interview

Say something like:

> "MVC is a pattern I follow in my MERN projects. It helps organize the backend by separating concerns:
> 
> - **Model** defines how data is structured in MongoDB, like Expense or User schemas.
>     
> - **Controller** contains logic for what happens when someone hits an endpoint.
>     
> - **View** is the frontend â€” the React app where the user interacts with the system.
>     
> 
> This makes the code clean, scalable, and easier to manage."
