| A can do in X days, B in Y days. Together they take? | $\frac{XY}{X+Y}$ days                |
| A is k times as efficient as B                       | Time taken by A = 1/k of B           |
| More men → less time                                 | M1 × D1 = M2 × D2 (Inverse Relation) |
| Pipes & Cisterns (reverse Time & Work)               | Inlet = positive, Outlet = negative  |
```math
Efficiency = (Total work / Time)
