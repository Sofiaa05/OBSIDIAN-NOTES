## **1. Data Parsing & Processing**

* Parse a CSV file and return a list of objects
* Read a JSON string and extract certain fields
* Parse server logs to count requests per IP address
* Extract domain names from a list of URLs
* Convert date formats (e.g., `2025-08-10` → `Aug 10, 2025`)
* Read a text file and count word frequencies

---

## **2. Validation Problems**

* Validate an email address (using regex or manual rules)
* Validate a strong password (min length, symbols, numbers, uppercase)
* Validate credit card number (Luhn’s algorithm)
* Validate an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)

## **3. Mini-System Simulations**

* **ATM Simulation**

  * Balance inquiry
  * Withdraw/deposit
  * PIN check
* **Library Management**

  * Add/remove/search books
  * Track borrowed books
* **Movie Ticket Booking**

  * Seat availability
  * Booking & cancellation
* **E-commerce Cart**

  * Add/remove products
  * Calculate total & apply discount

---

## **4. CRUD-like Console Tasks**

* Implement **signup/login** with username & password storage in memory
* Store and retrieve student records
* Implement a contact book with search by name or phone number

---

## **5. String & File Utilities**

* Compress a string using run-length encoding (`aaabb → a3b2`)
* Remove duplicate words from a sentence
* Find the most common word in a file
* Search for a keyword in a file and print matching lines

---

## **6. API & Networking Simulations**

*(If allowed in interview environment)*

* Fetch JSON from a mock API and display certain fields
* Simulate sending messages between users in memory

---

## **7. Business Logic Scenarios**

* Calculate tax for a given salary with different slabs
* Split a bill among multiple people (with tip percentage)
* Inventory stock alert (trigger warning when quantity < threshold)

---

These **aren’t hard in terms of algorithms**, but they **require structured thinking like in real development**:

* How will you store data?
* How will you handle invalid input?
* How will you make your code modular?
