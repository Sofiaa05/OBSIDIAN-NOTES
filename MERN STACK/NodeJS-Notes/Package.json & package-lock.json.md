### 2 ways of creating package.json
1. By running the command: **npm init**
2. When we install any module or library **using npm** then **package.json** file is created **automatically.**

* **Note:** we don’t create **package-lock.json** file manually because this file is automatically created and managed by the **npm.**
### NPM init :
* **Command-line instruction** used to **create a package.json file** for a Node JS package.
* There are a few questions asked by NPM each time the “init” command is run.
---
## Purpose :
### 1. package.json: 
- This file is primarily used for **managing and documenting metadata about the project**, including its **name, version, author, dependencies, scripts**, and other configuration details.
- Specifies scripts that can be run (e.g., `start`, `test`).
* It acts as a **manifest** for the project.
### 2. package-lock.json : 
- This file is **generated and updated automatically** by npm when **installing or**
**updating packages.**

* This file ensures consistency by **locking the exact dependency versions** installed.
---
## Dependency Specification :
### 1. package.json: 
- It contains the **list of dependencies** required for the project, along with their desired
**version ranges**.

### 2. package-lock.json : 
- Records the exact versions of dependencies and sub-dependencies and their exact installation locations.
- Ensures that all team members get the same package versions.

### **Differences at a Glance**

|Feature|`package.json`|`package-lock.json`|
|---|---|---|
|Purpose|Defines dependencies and project metadata|Locks exact dependency versions|
|Editable by user?|Yes|No (auto-generated)|
|Ensures consistency?|No|Yes|
|Contains exact versions?|No|Yes|

## Nodemon :
Nodemon is a **tool** that helps with Node.js development by **automatically restarting the application when it detects file changes**. It’s particularly useful when working on backend projects, as it **eliminates** the need to **manually stop and restart the server** after every code change.

### **Installing Nodemon**
    
    `npm install -g nodemon`
