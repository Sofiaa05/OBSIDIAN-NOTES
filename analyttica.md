Technical Skills & Experience (40–45 sec)
“I have worked with Java, Spring Boot, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I have good understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms, and I keep practicing problems on HackerRank to improve myself. “One of my projects is called _Metamorphsis_. It is a full-stack application where users can sign up, log in, and write messages for their future selves. They can also add images, voice notes, or video links, and these messages unlock on a future date with reminders sent through email. The app also includes a mood tracking feature. I built the frontend using React, the backend with Spring Boot, and MySQL as the database.”
