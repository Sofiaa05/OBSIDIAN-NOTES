### Extras
Q1: Can you explain the difference between object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming?  
A1: Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on using objects to represent data and methods, promoting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. In contrast, procedural programming emphasizes a sequence of actions or commands to be executed, which may lead to more complex code management as applications grow.  
  
Q2: How do you ensure the quality of your code?  
A2: I follow best practices such as writing unit tests, performing code reviews, and employing version control systems. Additionally, I use static code analysis tools to identify potential issues early and maintain coding standards.  
  
Q3: Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame the challenges.  
A3: I worked on a project with a tight deadline and complex requirements. To manage this, I prioritized tasks using Agile methodologies, held regular team stand-ups to address issues promptly, and collaborated closely with stakeholders to ensure alignment on project goals.  
  
Q4: What is your experience with version control systems like Git?  
A4: I am proficient in using Git for version control. I regularly create branches for feature development, manage merges, and resolve conflicts. I also utilize GitHub for collaboration and code reviews, ensuring a streamlined workflow.  
  
Q5: How do you stay updated with the latest programming trends and technologies?  
A5: I regularly attend webinars, participate in coding communities, and follow industry-related blogs and forums. I also engage in personal projects to experiment with new technologies and frameworks.
