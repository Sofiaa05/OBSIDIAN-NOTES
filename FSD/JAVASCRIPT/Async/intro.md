## 🧠 PART 1: Callback Functions — in Simple Words

### ❓ What is a function?

A block of code that does something when you call it.

```js
function sayHi() {
  console.log("Hi");
}
```

You call it: `sayHi();` → it prints “Hi”.

---

### ✅ Now… what is a **callback function**?

> A **callback** is a function you **pass as an argument** to **another function**, and it gets **called later**.

---

### 🧃 Real Life Example (Layman):

You're at a juice shop.

You say:  
"Make me orange juice.  
When it’s done, **call me**."

The guy makes juice (main function).  
Then **calls you back** (callback function) when it’s ready.

```js
function makeJuice(finishedCallback) {
  console.log("Making juice...");
  finishedCallback(); // calls you when done
}

function tellMeItIsReady() {
  console.log("Juice is ready!");
}

makeJuice(tellMeItIsReady); // You passed a function to another function
```

---

### 🔁 Recap in one line:

> A **callback** is just a function that runs **after** another one finishes its work.

---

## 🧠 PART 2: Synchronous vs Asynchronous — in Real Life

### ⏳ Synchronous (One-by-one, blocking)

Imagine you're cooking:

1. Boil water 🔥
    
2. Cook rice 🍚
    
3. Serve plate 🍽️
    

You wait for step 1 to finish before doing step 2.  
Each task **blocks** the next.

```js
console.log("Boil water");
console.log("Cook rice");
console.log("Serve food");
```

It prints in order — 1 → 2 → 3

---

### ⏱️ Asynchronous (Parallel, non-blocking)

Now imagine:

- You put water to boil, and while it's heating…
    
- You start chopping vegetables 🍅
    

You’re not waiting like a robot — you **do other things** while one thing is happening in the background.

That’s async.

```js
console.log("Start boiling water");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Water boiled (after 3 sec)");
}, 3000);

console.log("Cut vegetables");
console.log("Clean kitchen");
```

📦 Output:

```
Start boiling water
Cut vegetables
Clean kitchen
Water boiled (after 3 sec)
```

See? The waiting part didn’t block the rest.

---

## 🤖 So why do we need callbacks and async?

Because:

- JavaScript runs in **one thread** (1 task at a time)
    
- You don’t want slow things (like file reading, API calls, timers) to freeze everything
    
- So you **run them in background** and **use a callback** when they're done
    

---

### 💡 Common Async Functions:

- `setTimeout()`
    
- `setInterval()`
    
- Fetching data from API (`fetch()`)
    
- Reading files
    
- Clicking buttons / user actions
    

---

### 🧪 Callback in async:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside callback after 2 sec");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

✅ "Start" and "End" show up first.  
The callback runs **after** 2 seconds.

## ✅ Summary (Before We Get Technical)

|Concept|In Simple Words|
|---|---|
|Function|A block of code you can call and reuse|
|Callback|A function passed to another function|
|Synchronous|Runs step-by-step, blocks next step|
|Asynchronous|Doesn’t block, keeps going, handles later|

## 🧠 PART 3: Event Loop, Call Stack, and Callback Queue (Technical but visual)

### 🔧 What actually happens when JavaScript runs?

JavaScript uses:

- **Call Stack** 📚 → Runs functions one-by-one
    
- **Web APIs** 🌐 → Handle async stuff (timers, fetch, DOM events)
    
- **Callback Queue** 📩 → Stores callbacks waiting to be run
    
- **Event Loop** 🔄 → Checks if the stack is empty, then runs the next callback
    

---

### 🔄 Technical Flow (Visual):

```js
console.log("1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2");
}, 0);

console.log("3");
```

---

### 🧪 What happens behind the scenes:

1. `console.log("1")` → goes into **Call Stack** → runs → prints 1
    
2. `setTimeout(...)` → goes to **Web API** → timer starts in background
    
3. `console.log("3")` → runs → prints 3
    
4. Now Call Stack is empty ✅
    
5. Timer (0ms) is done → callback moves to **Callback Queue**
    
6. **Event Loop** says: “Call stack empty?” → Yes → runs the callback
    
7. Prints 2
    

### 🖨 Output:

```
1
3
2
```

Even though `setTimeout(..., 0)` looks instant, it’s **always async**, so its callback waits.

---

### 🔄 Summary of Roles:

|Part|What it does|
|---|---|
|Call Stack|Executes functions immediately|
|Web APIs|Handle async (setTimeout, fetch, events)|
|Callback Queue|Stores completed async callbacks|
|Event Loop|Sends callbacks to Call Stack when it’s empty|

---

### 🧠 So when is a callback async?

- **If passed to an async function**, like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or an event listener.
    
- These functions **do their job in background**, and then **push the callback** later.
    

---

### 🧩 Example: DOM event with callback

```js
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

- `addEventListener` tells the browser:
    
    > “When someone clicks, run this callback.”
    
- Until then, the function is waiting in Web API.
    
- When clicked, callback moves to **Callback Queue** → then Call Stack → runs.

## 🎯 Interview Tip: How to explain a callback

> "A callback is a function passed to another function that gets executed later. It’s useful for handling asynchronous operations like timers, network requests, or user interactions."
