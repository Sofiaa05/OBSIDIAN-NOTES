### 💡 Real-World Scenario:

Imagine you're building an online shopping system with the following steps:

1. **Place Order**
    
2. **Make Payment**
    
3. **Get Order Summary**
    
4. **Update Wallet**
    

We'll use these to understand:

---
### 👎 Code with Callback Hell:

```js
placeOrder(orderDetails, function(order) {
  makePayment(order, function(paymentStatus) {
    getOrderSummary(paymentStatus, function(summary) {
      updateWallet(summary, function(walletStatus) {
        console.log("Order completed and wallet updated");
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### ⛔ What does this look like?

- Deep nesting
    
- Hard to follow the flow
    
- If something fails (e.g., payment), it's hard to manage the error
    
- Code becomes **ugly, unreadable, and unmaintainable**
    

---

### 💬 How to explain in an interview:

> “Callback hell occurs when multiple asynchronous tasks are nested inside each other using callbacks. In this example, placing an order, making a payment, getting the summary, and updating the wallet all depend on the previous task — so each callback is inside the previous one. This leads to deeply indented, hard-to-maintain code that’s difficult to debug.”

---

##  2. Inversion of Control — Same Example

---

### 🔍 What is happening here?

You're writing a callback function (like `function(paymentStatus) { ... }`)  
But you’re **giving control** to someone else (maybe a library or payment API).

So you're trusting them to:

- Call your callback at the right time ✅
    
- Call it only once ✅
    
- Pass correct values ✅
    

---

### ❌ What if they mess up?

- Call your callback twice?
    
- Never call it at all?
    
- Throw an error inside your callback?
    

**You’re not in control anymore**.

---

### 💬 Interview answer:

> “Inversion of Control means I'm giving my function to another system or library and trusting it to call my function correctly. In the case of callbacks, once I pass my callback to `makePayment`, I’ve lost control over when and how it runs. If the system fails or misuses my callback, my program may break — this is a big risk when using plain callbacks.”

## 🧠 Summary:

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Callback Hell**|Deep nesting of async callbacks → unreadable and error-prone code|
|**Inversion of Control**|You give control of your callback to another function/system → loss of control|
