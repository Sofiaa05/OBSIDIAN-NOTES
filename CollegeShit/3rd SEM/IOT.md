### Logical Design of IOT
- describes the **architecture and flow of information** — how IoT components work together logically to perform functions such as data collection, processing, communication.
- While the **physical design** focuses on _hardware (devices, sensors, connectivity)_,  the **logical design** focuses on _data flow, functionality, and interaction between software and network components_.
#### 1. Communication Models in IoT

- Communication models define _how_ data is exchanged between IoT devices, the cloud, and applications.
- It define **who sends**, **who receives**, and **how** the communication happens

##### 1. Request–Response Model

- This is a **simple and synchronous** communication model where a client sends a **request message** to a server, and the server replies with a **response message**.  
- Communication occurs only when the client initiates it.

###### **Working**

1. The client sends a request for some resource or information.
    
2. The server receives the request, processes it, and sends back the required response.
    
3. The connection ends after the response is received.
    

###### Protocols Used

- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
    
- CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
    
###### Use Case

Used in applications that require **on-demand data**, like checking temperature, humidity, or weather information occasionally.

---

##### 2. Publish–Subscribe Model

- In this model, devices communicate **indirectly** using an **intermediate broker**.  
- Publishers send messages to specific **topics** handled by a **message broker**, and subscribers receive messages from those topics.
- The publisher and subscriber are **decoupled** — they do not know each other’s identity or location.

###### Working

1. **Publisher:** Sends messages to a broker under a topic (e.g., “/home/temperature”).
    
2. **Broker:** The central server that receives all messages from publishers and forwards them to the right subscribers
    
3. **Subscriber:** Subscribes to topics of interest and receives data

###### Protocols Used

- MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
    
- AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    
###### Use Case

Used in **real-time monitoring** applications like smart cities, home automation, or IoT dashboards.

---

##### 3. Push–Pull Model


- The push–pull model is used when data producers and consumers operate **independently in time**.  
- Push client pushes data to a queue, and pull client retrieves data later when it is ready.

- This is an **asynchronous communication** model.

###### Working

1. **Push:** Devices or sensors generate data and push it into a **data queue or buffer**.
    
2. **Pull:** Consumer devices or applications pull data from that queue when they are ready to process it.
    
3. The queue helps balance differences in data production and consumption rates.
    
###### Protocols Used

- AMQP
    
- ZeroMQ
    
###### Use Case

Used in **data collection systems**, **IoT analytics**, and **cloud data pipelines**, where real-time processing is not critical.

---

##### 4. Exclusive Pair Model

- In the Exclusive Pair model, two devices establish a **persistent, one-to-one connection** for continuous data exchange.  
- This connection is **exclusive** — no third device participates.
- It supports **bi-directional communication** and **low latency**.

###### Working

1. Two devices form a dedicated communication link.
    
2. Data can flow in both directions anytime.
    
3. The connection remains active until explicitly closed.
    

###### Protocols Used

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    
- WebSocket
    
- Bluetooth

###### Use Case

Used in **wearable devices**, **vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)** systems, and **industrial machine communication** where continuous connectivity is needed.

| **Publish–Subscribe** | Broker-based          | Asynchronous           | MQTT, AMQP         | Scalable, efficient    | Requires broker      | Smart home, IoT monitoring    |
| **Push–Pull**         | Queue-based           | Asynchronous           | AMQP, ZeroMQ       | Balances load          | Possible delay       | Cloud data pipelines          |
| **Exclusive Pair**    | One-to-one persistent | Bi-directional         | TCP, WebSocket     | Real-time, low latency | Not scalable         | Wearables, connected vehicles |

    - **POST:** Send data (e.g., send sensor reading).
        
    - **PUT:** Update data.
        
    - **DELETE:** Remove data.
        
- **Data Format:** JSON or XML.
    
- **Example:** A mobile app requesting temperature data from a weather sensor cloud service using `GET /temperature`.
    

**Advantages:**

- Simple and lightweight.
    
- Works with most devices and platforms.
    

**Disadvantages:**

- Less suitable for continuous real-time streaming.
    

---

##### b. WebSocket API

- Enables **real-time, two-way communication** between client and server.
- Allows bi-directional, full duplex communication between clients and servers.
    
- Once a connection is established, both sides can send data anytime.
    
- **Example:** Real-time chat or live sensor monitoring dashboard.
    
- **Protocol:** Uses TCP.
    
- **Advantage:** Faster communication than REST (no repeated HTTP requests).

### IOT Layers
- IoT architecture is generally **divided into 5 layers**, each with specific functions to make IoT systems **efficient, scalable, and secure**.
#### 1. Perception Layer (Sensing Layer)

- **Definition:** The physical layer that consists of sensors and devices.
    
- **Function:** Captures data from the environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion).
    
- **Examples:** Sensors (temperature, light, pressure), actuators (motors, switches).
    

---

#### 2. Network Layer (Transmission Layer)

- **Definition**: Responsible for transmitting data between devices and the cloud or servers.
    
- **Function**: Ensures reliable data transfer using various communication protocols.
    
- **Examples**: MQTT, CoAP, cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Zigbee.
    

---

#### 3. Edge/Fog Computing Layer (Optional Layer in Modern IoT)

- **Definition**: Processes data near the source rather than sending it all to the cloud.
    
- **Function**: Reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and enhances response time for time- sensitive applications.
    
- **Examples**: Local gateways, edge devices.
    

---

#### 4. Application Layer

### Messaging Protocols

#### 1. MQTT
- simple, lightweight messaging protocol used to establish communication between multiple devices having low bandwidth and low power requirements.
- It is a TCP-based protocol relying on the publish-subscribe model. 

##### Working

1. The **publisher** connects to the **broker** using TCP/IP.
    
2. The publisher **sends (publishes)** a message to a **topic** (e.g., “home/livingroom/temp”).
    
3. The broker **forwards** the message to all **subscribers** who subscribed to that topic.
    
4. The subscriber receives and processes the data.
##### Advantages of MQTT

- Very **lightweight and efficient**
    
- Works well over **low-bandwidth or unreliable networks**
    
- **Scalable** and supports thousands of IoT clients


##### Limitations

- **Requires broker** (central point of failure if not managed properly)
    
- **TCP-based**, so not ideal for extremely constrained devices
- lacks encryption

---

#### 2. CoAP
- It is a web-based protocol that resembles It is a web-based protocol that resembles HTTP. 
- It is also based on the request-response model. 
- Based on the REST-style architecture

##### Working
CoAP uses a **client-server model** (like a small web request):

1. **Client:** Requests data (like asking a sensor “what’s the temperature?”).
    
2. **Server:** Sends data back (temperature reading).
    
3. Supports **asynchronous updates** (the server can notify the client if something changes).
##### Advantages
- **Lightweight and Efficient** – Small header size, uses minimal memory and bandwidth.

    
- **RESTful Design** – Works like HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), easy to integrate with web/cloud.
    
- **Fast Communication** – Uses UDP, reducing latency compared to TCP.

##### Disadvantages;
- **Less Reliable than TCP** – Since it uses UDP, packets can be lost unless confirmable messages are used.
    
- **Line-of-sight or Short-range Limitations** – Dependent on network reliability for constrained environments
