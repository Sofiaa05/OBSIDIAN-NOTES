~={yellow}**printf()**=~ is a function used to output/print text to the screen.

~={yellow}**return 0**=~ ends the main() function. The return value of `main()` is used as the program's **exit status**, which indicates whether the program executed successfully or encountered an error. 

In most systems:
- 0 means successful execution.
- A non-zero value (e.g., 1, -1, 2, etc.) usually indicates an error or abnormal termination.

~={yellow}**\n :**=~  The newline character (`\n`) is called an **escape sequence**, and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
