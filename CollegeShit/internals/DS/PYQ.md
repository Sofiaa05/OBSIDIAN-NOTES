'### Arrays:

#### Address Calculation (2 marks):
- Calculate the address of Arr\[2]\[3] for int Arr\[5]\[3], where base address=100, size of
int is 2 bytes
- Write formula to calculate address of arr\[i]\[j] where arr\[n]\[m] is declared and stored at memory location 100 in row major order. Array index, starts with 0.
- Int Art\[3]\[5]. If array index starts with 0 what will be the address o f Arr\[2]\[4] in column
major order.
#### Memory allocation (2 marks):

### Linked Lists: 
- reverse, merge 2 sorted LLs, InsBeg(), Insbefore(), insEnd() circular LL, add two polynomials. (10 Marks)
- self referential pointer (2 marks) 
### Queue:
##### Operations with Arrays
- underflow and overflow condition with array implementation of queue (2 marks) 
- implement (insert, delete) circular queue using array. (10 marks) 
##### Operations with LL:
-  underflow and overflow condition with LL implementation of queue (2 marks) 
##### data structure was not defined for this:
- Dequeue vs Deque. (2 marks) Structure to implement both or any one. (3 marks)
### Stack:
##### Stack trace:
- to convert infix to postfix 
##### algorithm:
- to convert infix to postfix
##### Example questions ;
- ( A * B + C / D ) : prefix = + A B / C D , postfix = A B \* C D / +
- ((A+B)^C+E)-F =  prefix=  - + ^ + A B C E F ,postfix = A B + C ^ E + F -
### BST: 
-  (definitions) - BST, strict BST (2 marks), creation BST and insertion node in BST (10 marks)
	- Justify that the height of BST is Log2n.
	- minimum number of nodes in strict BST at any level?
