## Unit - 1
### OOSE :
**software development methodology** that applies **object-oriented principles** to the entire **software engineering process**

	- object oriented approach
	- graphic modeling (uml)
	- use case driven (real world use cases)
	- incremental development
---

### Review of Objects and Classes :
#### 1. Class:
- **blueprint or template** that defines the **attributes (data members) and behaviors (methods) of an object.**
```java
class Cat {
	// attributes
	string breed;
	int age;

	//methods
	void purring(){
		sop(" I am " + breed + "I purr when im happiest!" + "i am " + age +"years old");
	}
}
```
 
 #### 2. objects: 
 - **instance** of a class that has actual values assigned to its properties.
 ```java
 public class Main{
	 psvm(...){
		 Cat cat = new Cat();
		 cat.breed="scottish fold";
		 cat.age=4;
		 cat.purring();
	 }
 }
```

#### Class vs object
| Feature           | Class                   | Object                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Definition        | A template or blueprint | An instance of a class                        |
| Memory Allocation | No memory is allocated  | Memory is allocated when an object is created |
| Example           | `Cat` class             | `cat` object                                  |

###  Links and Association in Object-Oriented Concepts :

#### 1. Links

- **Connection** between two **objects** that interact with each other. 
- Represents an **instance-level relationship** between objects.
#####  Example:

- 2 classes : `Student` and `Course`.
- If a `Student` object (e.g., John) is enrolled in a `Course` object (e.g., OOSE), then the specific connection between **John and OOSE** is a **link**.

#### **2. Association**
- Relationship between two or more classes at the class level. 
- relationship may be **one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many**
- It defines how objects of one class are related to objects of another class.
##### Example:

- A `Student` can be **associated** with only one `Course`.
- A `Course` can have multiple `Students`.


| Feature    | Link                                  | Association                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Level      | Instance level                        | Class level                  |
| Definition | Relationship between specific objects | Relationship between classes |
|            |                                       |                              |
#### Type of Association

1. **Unidirectional Association:**
- one class is aware and associated with another class; the reverse is not true. 
- Example: library-book

2. **Bidirectional Association:**  
- The classes are aware of each other and interact with one another. 
- For example: car - ngine

---

### Aggregation and Composition :
#### 1. Aggregation
special form of Association where:****¬†¬†

- It represents Has-A‚Äôs relationship.
- It is a¬†**unidirectional association**
- In Aggregation,¬†**both entries can survive individually***¬†which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity. (loosely coupled)
- Library - Book `Library` contains `Book`, but `Book` can exist independently.

![[Pasted image 20250317221119.png]]
#### 2. Composition: 
**restricted form of Aggregation** in which two entities are **highly dependent** on each other.¬†¬†

- It represents¬†**part-of**¬†relationship.
- Both entities are dependent on each other.
- **Bidirectional association.**
- the composed object¬†**cannot exist** without the other entity.
- car-engine `Car` contains `Engine`, and if `Car` is destroyed, `Engine` is also destroyed.

---
### Generalisation and Specialisation :
#### 1. Generalisation
- Bottom-up method used to combine two or more classes  into a parent (superclass).

**Key Points**:

- It follows **"IS-A"** relationship.
- The parent class is more **generic**, while the child classes are more **specific**.
- uses **Inheritance** 

![[Pasted image 20250317183000.png]]

#### 2. Specialisation :
- Opposite of generalization. 
- Creating **subclasses** from an existing superclass
- uses inheritance

![[Pasted image 20250317183350.png]]

**UML:**
![[Pasted image 20250317221217.png]]

---
### Inheritance:
- mechanism where **child class (subclass)** derives properties and behaviors from a **parent class (superclass)**.
- This helps in **code reusability** and promotes the **"IS-A" relationship** between classes.
#### Types of Inheritance

1. **Single Inheritance** 
2. **Multilevel Inheritance** ‚Üí A child inherits from another child class (like a chain).
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance** ‚Üí Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent.
4. **Multiple Inheritance (Not in Java)** ‚Üí A child inherits from multiple parents 
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** ‚Üí Combination of different types 

![[Pasted image 20250317203032.png]]

---
### Polymorphism:

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
    
    - Methods with the **same name but different parameters**.
    - The method call is determined at compile-time.
    - Achieved using **Method Overloading**.
2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**
    
    - A **child class redefines** a method from the parent class.
    - The method call is determined at runtime.
    - Achieved using **Method Overriding**.
---

### Abstract Classes :
- can not be instantiated by itself.
- Needs to be inherited
- It may have both abstract (method with no definition only declaration) and non-abstract methods(methods with definition and declaration). 
- Abstract methods must be implemented in subclasses.
- declared using the **‚Äúabstract‚Äù** keyword in its class definition.
```java
abstract class Animal 
{
    int color;
    // An abstract function
    abstract void makeSound();
    void sleep(){
	    sop("sleeping");
    }
}
class car, class dog.
```

---
### Metadata


- Metadata is **"data about data."** 
- In OOSE, metadata describes **structure, attributes (data types, constraints) and behavior of objects, classes, and relationships** within a software system.
---
### Reusability:
- use existing code in different parts of program. without rewriting new.
- improves efficiency, readability, consistency, reduce redundancy.
- achieved through inheritance, polymorphism.

### UML (Unified Modeling Language)  :
- **Standardized visual language** used **for modeling software systems.** 
- It helps in **designing, visualizing, and documenting** object-oriented systems.
- Developed in 1990s, to standardize software modeling, as multiple modeling methods existed, leading to inconsistencies. Later, became the **industry standard** for software modeling.
#### Need?

- supports OOPs
- facilitating better understanding for non programmers
- improves communication
- time saving

---
### UML Diagrams :
#### 1. Structural UML Diagrams:
- focus on the static aspects of a system, such as its components and their relationships.
##### 1. Class Diagrams :
- Represents classes, attributes, methods, and relationships between classes.

![[Pasted image 20250318000315.png]]

###### Multiplicity :
- Indicates the number of instances of one class that can be linked to an instance of the other class. 
- For example, each company will have one or more employees (not zero), and each employee currently works for zero or one companies.

Multiplicity notations are placed near the end of an association.

The different cardinality options are :

- `1`¬†Only 1
- `0..1`¬†Zero or One
- `1..*`¬†One or more
- `*`¬†Many
- `n`¬†n (where n>1)
- `0..n`¬†zero to n (where n>1)
- `1..n`¬†one to n (where n>1)

| - LoginForm    |
| - RegisterForm |
+----------------+

```

#### 1. Behavioral UML Diagrams :
- describe the dynamic aspects of a system, such as interactions and workflows.
##### 1. Use Case Diagram :
**Key Components of Use Case Modeling**

‚úÖ **Actors** ‚Äì Represent external entities that interact with the system. These can be:

- **Primary Actors:** Users who initiate a use case (e.g., Customer).
- **Secondary Actors:** Systems or users supporting the process (e.g., Payment Gateway).

‚úÖ **Use Cases** ‚Äì Specific actions or processes that an actor performs in the system.

- **Example:** "Login," "Place Order," "Make Payment."

‚úÖ **Relationships** ‚Äì interaction between use cases and actors.

- **Association:** Direct interaction between actor and use case.
- **Include:** One use case calls another as a common function (e.g., "Login" is included in "Checkout"). (checkout--<\<include>>->payment)
- **Extend:** A use case may optionally extend another (e.g., "Apply Discount" extends "Make Payment"). (make payment<--<\<extend>>--apply discount)
##### 2. Activity Diagram:
- Represents workflows, like a flowchart.

![[Pasted image 20250318001917.png]]

##### 3. Sequence Diagram :
