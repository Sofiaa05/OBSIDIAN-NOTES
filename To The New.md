#### Core Java:
- OOPs
- Exception Handling
- Collection frameworks

#### DSA
1. Replace every element in the array with the product of the previous and next elements. 
2. Return count of subarray having non repeating digits 
3. Sum of composit number in array
4. Find maximum subarray sum 
5. Middle of a linked list 
6. Find unique element
7. Convert a given number to its byte code and count the Number of 1's in the Byte code and sisplay the result
8. Given an array where every element occurs two times, except one element which occurs only once. Find the element that occurs once. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/find-element-appears-array-every-element-appears-twice/) I gave two approaches to the question, first keeping a frequency array and storing the number of times an element occurs in it, the second approach was based XOR.
9. Given a string, check if it is palindrome or not. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/c-program-check-given-string-palindrome/)
10. Given a string, the task is to find the frequency of each word in a string. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/calculate-the-frequency-of-each-word-in-the-given-string/).
11.  reverse every word of a sentence
12. frequency of charecters in a string.
13. merge sort ,
14. find middle of stack , 
15. convert arr into linked list

#### SQL
- joins
- normalisation
- SQL query-Find 2nd highest salary. Join between three tables and related queries.
-  Write a query to find the name of the employee getting the maximum salary. Assume there are two tables: one with employee ID and name, and another with employee ID, month, and salary.
#### Conceptual
what Data Structure is used to maintain hashmaps, queue and Deque
Design a Database of one to many relations, Count and Cross Join queries
