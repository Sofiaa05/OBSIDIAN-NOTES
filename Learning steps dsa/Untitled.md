### Recommended Learning Sequence:

1. **Binary Search**

2. **Two Pointers** 
    
    - Why: This is one of the simplest techniques to understand and helps build intuition for array manipulation. Problems like "pair sum" or "remove duplicates" are great starting points.
        
    - Example problems: Reverse an array, find a pair with a given sum in a sorted array.


3. **Frequency Array:** 
 - A **frequency array** (or hashmap/frequency map) is a data structure used to **count how many times each element appears** in an array or string.

5. **Sliding Window** 
    
    - Why: Builds on the two-pointer idea but focuses on subarrays/substrings. Helps understand optimal substructure in problems.
        
    - Example problems: Maximum sum subarray of size `k`, longest substring without repeating characters.
        
6. **Fast and slow pointers**

7. **Prefix Sum/Difference** (done)
    
    - Why: Introduces the idea of precomputing to optimize range queries. Simple but powerful for problems involving cumulative sums or differences.
        
    - Example problems: Find the equilibrium index, subarray sum equals `k`.
        
8. **Hashing**
    
    - Why: Hashing (hash maps/dictionaries) is a fundamental tool for optimizing lookups and counting. Many problems rely on it for O(1) time complexity.
        
    - Example problems: Two-sum, first non-repeating character in a string.
        
9. **Sorting**
    
    - Why: Many algorithms rely on sorted data. Understanding sorting (and its time complexity) is crucial for optimizing solutions.
        
    - Example problems: Merge overlapping intervals, anagrams.
        
10. **In-place Algorithms** (done)
    
    - Why: Teaches you to solve problems with O(1) space complexity, which is often asked in interviews.
        
    - Example problems: Move zeroes to the end, rotate an array.
        
11. **Kadane's Algorithm**
    
    - Why: A specialized but important algorithm for maximum subarray problems. Builds on prefix sum and sliding window intuition.
        
    - Example problems: Maximum subarray sum, maximum product subarray.
        
12. **Recursion**
    
    - Why: A foundational programming concept that leads to backtracking and dynamic programming. Start with simple problems before diving deeper.
        
    - Example problems: Fibonacci, factorial, tree traversals.
    - 
        
13. **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** (done)
    
    - Why: A niche but elegant algorithm for majority element problems. Best learned after mastering basics.
        
    - Example problems: Majority element (appears more than `n/2` times).
