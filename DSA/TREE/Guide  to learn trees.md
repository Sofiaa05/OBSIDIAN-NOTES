### **Count Total Nodes in a Tree**

**Concept:** Simple traversal (DFS/BFS) → count all nodes.

- 🔹 **LeetCode #222 – Count Complete Tree Nodes** (⏱️ Medium)  
    🧠 Learn to count nodes efficiently using properties of complete binary trees.  
    → [Use BFS or recursive DFS first, then learn the optimized height-based approach.]
    
- 🔹 **LeetCode #94 – Binary Tree Inorder Traversal** (Easy)  
    🧠 Practice visiting every node — core skill used in counting.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Count Leaf and Non-Leaf Nodes**

**Concept:** Nodes with 0 children = leaf, others = non-leaf.

- 🔹 **LeetCode #404 – Sum of Left Leaves** (Easy)  
    🧠 Learn to detect leaf nodes (left-side only).  
    → Adapt logic to count all leaves, not just left ones.
    
- 🔹 **LeetCode #257 – Binary Tree Paths** (Easy)  
    🧠 Helps identify leaf nodes while building paths → perfect to strengthen leaf detection logic.
    

---

### **3️⃣ Find Height (Maximum Depth) of a Tree**

**Concept:** Recursion (DFS) or Level Order (BFS).

- 🔹 **LeetCode #104 – Maximum Depth of Binary Tree** (Easy ✅ Must Do)  
    🧠 Classic height/depth problem.  
    → Try both recursive and iterative (level order) approaches.
    

---

### **4️⃣ Print All Nodes at a Given Level**

**Concept:** BFS with level tracking.

- 🔹 **LeetCode #102 – Binary Tree Level Order Traversal** (Easy ✅ Must Do)  
    🧠 Each level’s nodes printed in list form → exactly what this concept covers.
    
- 🔹 **LeetCode #107 – Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II** (Easy)  
    🧠 Similar but in reverse level order (bottom to top).
    

---

### **5️⃣ Check if a Tree is Empty**

**Concept:** Base condition understanding.

- ⚙️ This is a **logic check** (not on LeetCode).  
    Still, it’s foundational — used in almost every tree problem as:
    
    `if (root == null) return 0;`
    

---

### **6️⃣ Find the Sum of All Node Values**

**Concept:** DFS/BFS traversal + accumulation.

- 🔹 **LeetCode #563 – Binary Tree Tilt** (Easy)  
    🧠 While computing tilt, you sum subtree node values — great for sum logic.
    
- 🔹 **LeetCode #112 – Path Sum** (Easy)  
    🧠 Involves summing node values along paths → strengthens recursive summation.
    

---

### 🧩 Bonus (Combines Above Skills)

- 🔹 **LeetCode #110 – Balanced Binary Tree** (Easy)  
    🧠 Uses height calculation recursively; good practice after mastering depth logic.
    
- 🔹 **LeetCode #543 – Diameter of Binary Tree** (Easy-Medium)  
    🧠 Builds on maxDepth concept; perfect for next-level depth logic.
