| `CHAR_LENGTH()` | Count how many **characters** a user typed (e.g., password length)                       |
| `LENGTH()`      | Measure **storage size** in bytes (important for VARCHAR limits or storage optimization) |

Use `CHAR_LENGTH()` when you care about **how many characters**.  

Use `LENGTH()` when you care about **how much space it takes** (in bytes).
